# Resources to Get Started in Bioinformatics

### Python
If you take the [CodeAcademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python), work your way through a [book](http://amzn.to/2dGx2n8) or [two](http://amzn.to/2dGwC0o), and then try your hand at some test problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/), you'll be ready to start working on a small real-world project. 
##### Tutorials
 - [CodeAcademy Python Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - $20 per month, but worth it as a gentle introduction
 - [LearnPython.org Interactive Tutorial](http://www.learnpython.org/) - Clunkier than CodeAcademy, but free

##### Books
- [*Python Crash Course*](http://amzn.to/2dGx2n8) - A good follow up to the CodeAcademy course
- [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](http://amzn.to/2dGv2eH) - How to use quick and dirty scripts to save considerable time
- [*Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science*](http://amzn.to/2dGwC0o) - Intended more as an introduction to the basics of CS. Very well written and thought out

##### Problem Sets
 - [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) - Bioinformatics and general programming problems of varying difficulty to test your skills
 - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - The original programming problem set, more math-heavy
 - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - A site with coding challenges designed for companies to recruit developers

##### Real-world Problems
 - [BioPython Active Projects](http://biopython.org/wiki/Active_projects)

### Linux / Shell / Bash / Unix
I would go straight for the online tutorial on this one. There's not terribly much you need to know to get started.

##### Tutorials
 - [Learn Shell](http://www.learnshell.org/) - All you need to get the basics down pat

##### Books
 - [*Linux Command Line*](http://amzn.to/2e6rDUT)
 - [*Classic Shell Scripting*](http://amzn.to/2dtuIwY)
 - [*Sed & Awk*](http://amzn.to/2e6sKUx) - Not pure bash, but a drill down into two very handy tools that let you powerfully edit text

### Git and GitHub
Version control systems let you create a repository of code so you can see all changes you make, annotate changes, collaborate without fear of conflicts, etc. The easiest way to see the benefit is to try it out. One such system for version control is `git` and the central repository for many such repositories is [GitHub](https://github.com/).

##### Tutorials
 - [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) - Free and very good introduction to git and GitHub
 - [CodeAcademy's Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) - CodeAcademy has a mix of free and paid tutorials for basic and advance usage of git

##### How to Contribute to GitHub Projects
 - [Beginner's guide to contributing to a GitHub project](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)
 - [Contribute to someone's repository](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html)
 - [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)
